    <p style="color: cornflowerblue;">    he Bata Shoe Organization was founded in 1894 by Czech businessman Tomas Bata in the city of Zlin, what was then Czechoslovakia. Coming from a family of 
        shoemakers with a long heritage of eight generations and over three hundred years, Tomas Bata capitalized on knowledge, expertise and skills to propel his newly 
        founded company forward. The introduction of factory automation, long distance retailing and 
        modernized shoe making ensured the profitability of the company from the very beginning. It is now the worldâ€™s largest manufacturer and marketer of footwear operating 
        across the globe       </p>
